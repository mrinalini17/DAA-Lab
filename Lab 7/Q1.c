/*Aim of the program: Write a program to implement the matrix chain multiplication problem
using M-table &amp; S-table to find optimal parenthesization of a matrix-chain product. Print the
number of scalar multiplications required for the given input.
Note# Dimensions of the matrices can be inputted as row and column values. Validate the
dimension compatibility.*/
